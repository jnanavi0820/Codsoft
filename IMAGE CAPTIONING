# Image Captioning AI System

An image captioning AI system combines computer vision and natural language processing to generate textual descriptions of images. Here's an overview of how such a system could be built:

## 1. Image Feature Extraction

Use a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) like VGG16, ResNet50, or Inception-v3 to extract visual features from input images. These models are typically pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image

# Load pre-trained ResNet50 model
model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)

# Function to extract features from an image
def extract_features(img_path):
    img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
    x = image.img_to_array(img)
    x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)
    features = model.predict(x)
    return features
```

## 2. Sequence Generation Model

Implement a sequence generation model, typically using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) like LSTM or GRU, or a transformer-based architecture. This model will generate captions based on the extracted image features.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Embedding, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Simplified LSTM-based caption generator
def create_model(vocab_size, max_length):
    inputs1 = Input(shape=(2048,))
    fe1 = Dropout(0.5)(inputs1)
    fe2 = Dense(256, activation='relu')(fe1)
    
    inputs2 = Input(shape=(max_length,))
    se1 = Embedding(vocab_size, 256, mask_zero=True)(inputs2)
    se2 = Dropout(0.5)(se1)
    se3 = LSTM(256)(se2)
    
    decoder1 = add([fe2, se3])
    decoder2 = Dense(256, activation='relu')(decoder1)
    outputs = Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')(decoder2)
    
    model = Model(inputs=[inputs1, inputs2], outputs=outputs)
    model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
    
    return model
```

## 3. Training Data

Prepare a dataset of images paired with their captions. Popular datasets include MSCOCO, Flickr8k, and Flickr30k.

## 4. Training Process

1. Extract features from all images in the training set.
2. Preprocess captions (tokenization, padding, etc.).
3. Train the sequence generation model using the image features and corresponding captions.

```python
# Pseudo-code for training
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for image, caption in training_data:
        image_features = extract_features(image)
        model.train_on_batch([image_features, caption_input], caption_output)
```

## 5. Caption Generation

To generate captions for new images:
1. Extract features from the new image.
2. Use the trained model to generate a sequence of words based on these features.

```python
def generate_caption(image_path, model, tokenizer, max_length):
    image_features = extract_features(image_path)
    in_text = 'start'
    for i in range(max_length):
        sequence = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([in_text])[0]
        sequence = pad_sequences([sequence], maxlen=max_length)
        yhat = model.predict([image_features, sequence], verbose=0)
        yhat = np.argmax(yhat)
        word = word_for_id(yhat, tokenizer)
        if word is None or word == 'end':
            break
        in_text += ' ' + word
    return in_text
```

## 6. Evaluation

Evaluate the model using metrics like BLEU, METEOR, or CIDEr, which compare generated captions to human-written reference captions.

This is a high-level overview of building an image captioning AI. In practice, you'd need to handle many details like data preprocessing, model fine-tuning, and possibly using more advanced architectures like attention mechanisms or transformer models for better performance.
